# HTML (HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)

In this article, we learn about Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which is a standard language that helps us to build web pages on the internet. It consists of a series of elements that can be used as a way to tell your web browsers about the structure of your web page like where the headings are, where the images are, and so on. Given this information, browsers use some default set of rules on how to display the given elements on your webpage.
